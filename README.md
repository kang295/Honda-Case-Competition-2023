## Context for the Challenge
# In a rapidly evolving automotive landscape, Battery Electric vehicles (BEVs) are gaining prominence due to their cost savings, environmental benefits, and reduced maintenance. However, as consumer preferences and values continue to diversify, companies face an increasingly complex challenge in distinguishing their offerings.
